# Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Kevin Kopczynski and I am an audio nerd, who's passionate about programming and always eager to learn and implement novel DSP algorithms. I believe that high-quality audio is essential, and I strive to create tools that can help others achieve just that. With a background in mixing and recording and a Master's degree in Music Technology from New York University, I am confident in my abilities to push audio to its limits.

If you're interested in collaborating on an audio plugin, don't hesitate to reach out! I'm always looking for new and exciting projects to work on. And if you play Super Smash Bros... Send me your Nintendo Switch friend code and let's see who's the real champion.

Thanks for visiting!
